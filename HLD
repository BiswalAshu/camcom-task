FOR CLUSTER
write Terraform code to set up kubernetes cluster
write terraform code to set up cluster auto scaler in the same cluster

switch to eksctl terraform has lot of policy issues

FOR MYSQL
write persistent volume config for storage from EBS, 
persistent volume claim config for accessing the storage from pv
stateful set config for mysql to use the pvc

create HorzontalPodAutoscaler for load based scaling of mysql pods

ISSUES
use aws-ebs for persistent volume
EBS is zonal service, limited to either 1a or 1b or 1c, so if node exists in any other zone, pods will fail -- potential solution node taints and node affinity
NODE_SELECTOR will trigger scale up if experssion doesnt match
